# Value-Iteration-Q-Learning
Reinforcement Learning with Value Iteration &amp; Q-Learning. We use the openAI gym for the environments. This was part of an assignment of the Radboud University.

# Files:
This Repository consist of a Report explaining the code. Furthermore we use graphicsLib.py and gridworld.py to represent the environments. Two jupyter notebooks combine the environments and the report for retraceablity.
